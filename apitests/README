Before running tests, ensure you have python-nosetests installed.

To run tests:

  - Ensure you have python-nose installed.
  - Copy apitests.conf.sample to apitests.conf and modify for your environment.
  - From the apitests/ directory execute:
    PYTHONPATH=./ nosetests

Note that these tests require modifications to a running Cobbler server. They
will attempt to clean up any test objects created, but it may be best to not
execute these against a production Cobbler server.
