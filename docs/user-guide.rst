API
###
Cobbler also makes itself available as an XML-RPC API for use by higher level management software. Learn more at
https://cobbler.github.io

Images
######

Cobbler can help with booting images physically and virtually, though the usage of these commands varies substantially
by the type of image. Non-image based deployments are generally easier to work with and lead to more sustainable
infrastructure. Some manual use of other commands beyond of what is typically required of Cobbler may be needed to
prepare images for use with this feature.

Non-import (manual) workflow
############################

The following example uses a local kernel and initrd file (already downloaded), and shows how profiles would be created
using two different automatic installation files -- one for a web server configuration and one for a database server.
Then, a machine is assigned to each profile.

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler check
    cobbler distro add --name=rhel4u3 --kernel=/dir1/vmlinuz --initrd=/dir1/initrd.img
    cobbler distro add --name=fc5 --kernel=/dir2/vmlinuz --initrd=/dir2/initrd.img
    cobbler profile add --name=fc5webservers --distro=fc5-i386 --autoinstall=/dir4/kick.ks --kernel-options="something_to_make_my_gfx_card_work=42 some_other_parameter=foo"
    cobbler profile add --name=rhel4u3dbservers --distro=rhel4u3 --autoinstall=/dir5/kick.ks
    cobbler system add --name=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --profile=fc5-webservers
    cobbler system add --name=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FE --profile=rhel4u3-dbservers
    cobbler report

Virtualization
##############

For Virt, be sure the distro uses the correct kernel (if paravirt) and follow similar steps as above, adding additional
parameters as desired:

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler distro add --name=fc7virt [options...]

Specify reasonable values for the Virt image size (in GB) and RAM requirements (in MB):

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler profile add --name=virtwebservers --distro=fc7virt --autoinstall=path --virt-file-size=10 --virt-ram=512 [...]

Define systems if desired. Koan can also provision based on the profile name.

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler system add --name=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FE --profile=virtwebservers [...]

If you have just installed Cobbler, be sure that the `cobblerd` service is running and that port 25151 is unblocked.

See the manpage for Koan for the client side steps.

Network Topics
##############

.. Z-PXE: https://github.com/beaker-project/zpxe

PXE Menus
=========

Cobbler will automatically generate PXE menus for all profiles that have the ``enable_menu`` property set. You can
enable this with:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   cobbler profile edit --name=PROFILE --enable-menu=yes

Running ``cobbler sync`` is required to generate and update these menus.

To access the menus, type ``menu`` at the ``boot:`` prompt while a system is PXE booting. If nothing is typed, the
network boot will default to a local boot. If "menu" is typed, the user can then choose and provision any Cobbler
profile the system knows about.

If the association between a system (MAC address) and a profile is already known, it may be more useful to just use
``system add`` commands and declare that relationship in Cobbler; however many use cases will prefer having a PXE
system, especially when provisioning is done at the same time as installing new physical machines.

If this behavior is not desired, run ``cobbler system add --name=default --profile=plugh`` to default all PXE booting
machines to get a new copy of the profile ``plugh``. To go back to the menu system, run
``cobbler system remove --name=default`` and then ``cobbler sync`` to regenerate the menus.

When using PXE menu deployment exclusively, it is not necessary to make Cobbler system records, although the two can
easily be mixed.

Additionally, note that all files generated for the PXE menu configurations are templatable, so if you wish to change
the color scheme or equivalent, see the files in ``/etc/cobbler``.

Default PXE Boot behavior
=========================

What happens when PXE booting a system when Cobbler has no record of the system being booted?

By default, Cobbler will configure PXE to boot to the contents of ``/etc/cobbler/default.pxe``, which (if unmodified)
will just fall through to the local boot process. Administrators can modify this file if they like to change that
behavior.

An easy way to specify a default Cobbler profile to PXE boot is to create a system named ``default``. This will cause
``/etc/cobbler/default.pxe`` to be ignored. To restore the previous behavior do a ``cobbler system remove`` on the
``default`` system.

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler system add --name=default --profile=boot_this
    cobbler system remove --name=default

As mentioned in earlier sections, it is also possible to control the default behavior for a specific network:

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler system add --name=network1 --ip-address=192.168.0.0/24 --profile=boot_this

PXE boot loop prevention
========================

If you have your machines set to PXE first in the boot order (ahead of hard drives), change the ``pxe_just_once`` flag
in ``/etc/cobbler/settings.yaml`` to 1. This will set the machines to not PXE on successive boots once they complete one
install. To re-enable PXE for a specific system, run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    cobbler system edit --name=name --netboot-enabled=1

Containerization

We have a test-image which you can find in the Cobbler repository and an old image made by the community:

Web-Interface
#############

Please be patient until we have time with the 4.0.0 release to create a new web UI. The old Django based was preventing
needed change inside the internals in Cobbler.
