<h4>Welcome</h4>

<p>
This is the web configuration interface for a <A HREF="http://cobbler.et.redhat.com">Cobbler</A> Server.  Cobbler is an automated net install and update server for Linux operating systems.  You can use this web interface to decide what you want to install and where -- and then deploy that configuration using network booting (PXE), or do reinstalls and virtual installs with "koan".  There is also a koan live CD if you can't set up a PXE environment and still have bare-metal install needs.</p>

<p>
The Cobbler WebUI is designed for simplifying day-to-day usage of the Cobbler provisioning server.  It performs
<i>most</i> but not <i>all</i> of the functions the command line tool "cobbler" or the API can perform.  If you have
not already done so, you may be interested to read more about Cobbler at <A HREF="http://cobbler.et.redhat.com">
cobbler.et.redhat.com</A> and at <A HREF="https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler">fedorahosted.org</A>.
Those pages contain further documentation, tips & tricks, and links to the mailing list and users/developers
IRC channel.
</p>

<p>
It is probably a good idea to read the <A HREF="/cobbler/webui/cobbler.html">Cobbler manpage</A>, which for the most part focuses on cobbler as run from the command line.  Admins will need to use the command line some, so please do read the docs if you are in charge of the Cobbler server -- or if you need more detail about what some of the options mean.
</p>

<p>
The Cobbler server install should have started your cobbler install with running "cobbler check" locally to resolve potential configuration problems.  If not,
please do so now before continuing.   This will make sure your installation is configured and ready to go.  The rest
of this document will mainly be detailing the differences between the CLI (as described in the manpage) and the Web interface.
</p>

<p>
While you can run the equivalent of "cobbler distro add" commands from the manpage, you can not run
the very powerful "cobbler import".  So, if you want to start off your boot server using some
content from a DVD or an rsync mirror -- running cobbler import locally is also a good bet.
</p>

<p>
Another command that you cannot run via the web interface is "cobbler reposync", which can be a fairly long-running operation
that you may want to put on a crontab.  You also cannot edit the cobbler settings file (this is more
of a precaution against locking yourself out of the WebUI), but you can view it.  For instance this means
that if you want Cobbler to help manage your DHCP config (great!) you can do that through the Web UI
but you have to turn that on in the settings file (be sure to restart cobblerd after making changes).  Furthermore, other configuration and template files in /etc/cobbler (that are not kickstart templates) also have to be edited locally.  
</p>

<p>
Your Cobbler server administrator may have set cobbler up to allow access to only certain objects for certain user accounts.  In the event of this, you will see messages in the interface that indicate when you do not have permissions to perform certain actions.  Contact your Cobbler server administrator to resolve these items or to learn more if you have questions.
</p>

<p>
For more information about all that Cobbler can do, please see the <A HREF="/cobbler/webui/cobbler.html">manpage documentation</A>.  Details on setup of this web user interface are also included in the manpage documentation.   For commands like
"cobbler distro add" and "cobbler distro edit" (etc) the concepts presented in the manpage documentation translate
to what you see in the Web UI in a one-to-one relationship.  The syntax, values, and meanings of commands and
variables are all the same. 
</p>

Great.  <A HREF="/cobbler/web">Let's start deploying.</A>
