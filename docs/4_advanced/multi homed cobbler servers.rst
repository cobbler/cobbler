Multi-Homes cobbler servers
***************************

How do you use Cobbler to provision machines onto multiple different subnets, assuming no DNS tricks can be employed,
and where the server to provision the systems has different addresses on both sides of the "fence". Normally I'd hope
that you could say "bootserver" as a resolvable hostname is resolved on all sides, but what if you can't have that?
Suppose you have no working DNS. Now you need to be able to have different values for the address of the cobbler server.

Each profile and system object can take a ``--server`` parameter, which will replace the value used for 'server' in the
cobbler settings file.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobbler system edit --name=foo --server=server2.example.org

This parameter can also be used to support multiple cobbler servers from a centrally managed configuration (though
cobbler replicate is better suited to the task.
