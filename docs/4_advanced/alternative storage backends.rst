****************************
Alternative storage backends
****************************

General
#######

Cobbler saves object data via serializers implemented as Cobbler :ref:`modules`. This means Cobbler can be extended to
support other storage backends for those that want to do it. Today, cobbler ships three such modules alternate backends:
MySQL, MongoDB and CouchDB.

The default serializer is **serializer_catalog** which uses JSON in ``/var/lib/cobbler/config/<object>`` directories,
with one file for each object definition. It is very fast, however people with a large number of systems can still
experience slowness, especially if cobbler lives on a disk partition that is slow or heavily utilized. Users with such
setups should ensure ``/var/lib/cobbler`` is mounted on a dedicated disk that offers higher performance (15K SAS or a
SAN LUN for example).

An older legacy serializer, "serializer_yaml" is deprecated and is only around to support older installs that have not
yet upgraded to serializer_catalog by changing the serializer values in ``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf`` and restarting
cobblerd.

Details
=======

Here's what the relavant parts of modules.conf look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [serializers]
    settings = serializer_catalog
    distro = serializer_catalog
    profile = serializer_catalog
    system = serializer_catalog
    repo = serializer_catalog
    etc...

.. note:: Be sure to add a line for every object type supported in your version of cobbler. Read the
   :ref:`cobbler-primitives` section for more details.

Suppose, however, that you (just to be contrary), want to save everything in Marshalled XML because you liked angle
brackets a whole lot (we don't!). Easy enough, just write a new serializer module that did this and then could change
the file to:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [serializers]
    settings = serializer_catalog
    distro = serializer_xml
    profile = serializer_xml
    system = serializer_xml
    repo = serializer_xml
    etc...

This is all just an example -- in your environment, you may have more complex needs -- or even some weird ones.

Often folks ask about whether we can save and read from LDAP, though currently such a serializer is not implemented,
though we might be interested in it if it was performant enough.

One Note of Warning
===================

The "settings" serializer should always be "serializer_catalog", or at least should read ``/var/lib/cobbler/settings``
and treat it as a YAML file. Don't change it unless you know what you are doing, as that file (in YAML format) is
packaged as part of the Cobbler RPM.

Future versions of Cobbler may change this default, and revert to using the YAML config only if no JSON config is found.

Notes on serializer_catalog
===========================

Serializer catalog will save individual files in:

.. code-block:: bash

    /var/lib/cobbler/config/distros.d
    /var/lib/cobbler/config/profiles.d
    /var/lib/cobbler/config/systems.d
    etc...

Files are named after the name of each object, for instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    /var/lib/cobbler/config/systems.d/foo.json

On EL 4 and before, the simplejson implementation has some unicode issues, so YAML is still the default on those
systems. YAML is significantly slower, so this is more reason to install Cobbler on EL 5 and later. (Or rather, json is
300x faster!)

The filenames for YAML files do not have an extension.

.. code-block:: bash

    /var/lib/cobbler/config/systems.d/foo

Cobbler knows how to upgrade YAML files to JSON if it is running on a platform that can use JSON, and will do so
transparently.

CouchDB
#######

.. warning:: This feature has been deprecated and will not be available in Cobbler 3.0.

Cobbler 2.0.x introduced support for CouchDB as alternate storage backend, primarily as a proof of concept for NoSQL
style databases. Currently, support for this backend is ALPHA-quality as it has not received significant testing.

Currently, CouchDB must be configured and running on the same system as the cobblerd daemon in order for Cobbler to
connect to it successfully. Additional SELinux rules may be required for this connection if SELinux is set to enforcing
mode.

Serializer Setup
================

Add or modify the following section in the ``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [serializers]
    settings = serializer_catalog
    distro = serializer_couchdb
    profile = serializer_couchdb
    system = serializer_couchdb
    repo = serializer_couchdb
    etc...

.. note:: Be sure to leave the settings serializer set to ``serializer_catalog``.

MongoDB
#######

.. warning:: This feature has been deprecated and will not be available in Cobbler 3.0.

Cobbler 2.2.x introduced support for MongoDB as alternate storage backend, due to the native use of JSON. Currently,
support for this backend is BETA-quality, and it should not be used for critical production systems.

Serializer Setup
================

Add or modify the following section in the ``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [serializers]
    settings = serializer_catalog
    distro = serializer_mongodb
    profile = serializer_mongodb
    system = serializer_mongodb
    repo = serializer_mongodb
    etc...

.. note:: Be sure to leave the settings serializer set to serializer_catalog.

MongoDB Configuration File
==========================

The configuration file for the MongoDB serializer is ``/etc/cobbler/mongodb.conf``. This is an INI-style configuration
file, which has the following default entries:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [connection]
    host = localhost
    port = 27017

MySQL
#####

.. warning:: This feature has been deprecated and will not be available in Cobbler 3.0.

Cobbler 2.4.0 introduced support for MySQL as alternate storage backend. Currently, support for this backend is
ALPHA-quality, and it should not be used for critical production systems.

Serializer Setup
================

Add or modify the following section in the ``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [serializers]
    settings = serializer_catalog
    distro = serializer_mysql
    profile = serializer_mysql
    system = serializer_mysql
    repo = serializer_mysql
    etc...

.. note:: Be sure to leave the settings serializer set to serializer_catalog.

MySQL Schema
============

The schema for the cobbler database is very simple, and essentially uses MySQL as a key/value store with a TEXT field
storing the JSON for each object. The schema is as follows:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE DATABASE cobbler;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cobbler.* TO 'cobbler'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'testing123';
    CREATE TABLE distro (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE profile (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE system (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE image (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE repo (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE mgmtclass (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE file (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;
    CREATE TABLE package (name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT) ENGINE=innodb;

MySQL Configuration File
========================

This serializer does not yet have a configuration file, and unfortunately still hard-codes certain database values in
the ``cobbler/modules/serializer_mysql.py`` file. If you modify the privileges or database name in the schema above, you
must edit the .py module as well (be sure to remove the .pyo/.pyc files for that modules) and restart cobblerd.
