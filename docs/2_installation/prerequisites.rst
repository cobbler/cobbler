Prerequisites
*************

Cobbler has both definite and optional prerequisites, based on the features you'd like to use. This section documents
the definite prerequisites for both a basic installation and when building/installing from source. Please see the
:ref:`managing-services-with-cobbler` section for details on the prerequisites for managing services, and other sections
may make note of other package requirements.

Please note that installing any of the packages here via a package manager (such as yum or apt) can and will require a
large number of ancilary packages, which we do not document here. The package definition should automatically pull these
packages in and install them along with cobbler, however it is always best to verify these requirements have been met
prior to installing cobbler or any of its components.
