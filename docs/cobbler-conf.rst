*********************
Cobbler Configuration
*********************

There are two main settings files which are located per default at ``/etc/cobbler/``:

- The file ``settings.yaml`` is following `YAML <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`_ specification.
- The file ``modules.conf`` is following
  `INI <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`_ specification.

.. note:: Since we are cleaning a lot of tech-debt this may change over time. We are trying to find the balance which
          format is the best for us to handle in the code and the best for admins to handle in the config files.

.. warning:: If you are using ``allow_dynamic_settings``, then the comments in the YAML file will vanish after the first
             change due to the fact that PyYAML doesn't support comments
             (`Source <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/90>`_)

There are additional configuration file locations which need to follow the YAML Syntax. These are loaded from the
``include`` directory in the ``settings.yaml`` file. Any key specified in one of these files overwrites values from the
main file.

.. warning:: When using ``allow_dynamic_settings`` the values are only persisted in the file ``settings.yaml``. This
             may lead to a non expected behaviour after ``cobblerd`` restarts. This is a
             `known issue <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2549>`_.

Updates to the yaml-settings-file
#################################

Starting with 3.2.1:

- We require the extension ``.yaml`` on our settings file to indicate the format of the file to editors and comply to
  standards of the YAML specification.
- We require the usage of booleans in the format of ``True`` and ``False``. If you have old integer style booleans with
  ``1`` and ``0`` this is fine but you may should convert them as soon as possible. We may decide in a future version to
  enforce our new way in a stricter manner. Automatic conversion is only done on a best-effort/available-resources
  basis.
- We enforce the types of values to the keys. Additional unexpected keys will throw errors. If you have those used in
  Cobbler please report this in our issue tracker. We have decided to go this way to be able to rely on the existence
  of the values. This gives us the freedom to write less access checks to the settings without loosing stability.

``settings.yaml``
#################

allow_duplicate_hostnames
=========================

If ``True``, Cobbler will allow insertions of system records that duplicate the ``--dns-name`` information of other
system records. In general, this is undesirable and should be left False.

default: ``False``

allow_duplicate_ips
===================

If ``True``, Cobbler will allow insertions of system records that duplicate the IP address information of other system
records. In general, this is undesirable and should be left False.

default: ``False``

allow_duplicate_macs
====================

If ``True``, Cobbler will allow insertions of system records that duplicate the mac address information of other system
records. In general, this is undesirable.

default: ``False``

allow_dynamic_settings
======================

If ``True``, Cobbler will allow settings to be changed dynamically without a restart of the ``cobblerd`` daemon. You can
only change this variable by manually editing the settings file, and you MUST restart ``cobblerd`` after changing it.

default: ``False``

always_write_dhcp_entries
=========================

Always write DHCP entries, regardless if netboot is enabled.

default: ``False``

anamon_enabled
==============

By default, installs are *not* set to send installation logs to the Cobbler server. With ``anamon_enabled``, automatic
installation templates may use the ``pre_anamon`` snippet to allow remote live monitoring of their installations from
the Cobbler server. Installation logs will be stored under ``/var/log/cobbler/anamon/``.

.. note:: This does allow an XML-RPC call to send logs to this directory, without authentication, so enable only if you
          are ok with this limitation.

default: ``False``

auth_token_expiration
=====================

How long the authentication token is valid for, in seconds.

default: ``3600``

authn_pam_service
=================

If using authn_pam in the ``modules.conf``, this can be configured to change the PAM service authentication will be
tested against.

default: ``"login"``

autoinstall_snippets_dir
========================

This is a directory of files that Cobbler uses to make templating easier. See the Wiki for more information. Changing
this directory should not be required.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/snippets``

autoinstall_templates_dir
=========================

This is a directory of files that Cobbler uses to make templating easier. See the Wiki for more information. Changing
this directory should not be required.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/templates``

bind_chroot_path
================

Set to path of bind chroot to create bind-chroot compatible bind configuration files. This should be automatically
detected.

default: ``""``

bind_master
===========

Set to the ip address of the master bind DNS server for creating secondary bind configuration files.

default: ``127.0.0.1``

boot_loader_conf_template_dir
=============================

Location of templates used for boot loader config generation.

default: ``"/etc/cobbler/boot_loader_conf"``

bootloaders_dir
===============

The location where Cobbler searches for the bootloaders to copy into the web directory.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/loaders``

grubconfig_dir
==============

The location where Cobbler searches for GRUB configuration files.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/grub_config``

build_reporting_*
=================

Email out a report when Cobbler finishes installing a system.

- enabled: Set to ``true`` to turn this feature on
- email: Which addresses to email
- ignorelist: TODO
- sender: Optional
- smtp_server: Used to specify another server for an MTA.
- subject: Use the default subject unless overridden.

defaults:

.. code:: YAML

    build_reporting_enabled: false
    build_reporting_sender: ""
    build_reporting_email: [ 'root@localhost' ]
    build_reporting_smtp_server: "localhost"
    build_reporting_subject: ""
    build_reporting_ignorelist: [ "" ]

buildisodir
===========

Used for caching the intermediate files for ISO-Building. You may want to use a SSD, a tmpfs or something which does not
persist across reboots and can be easily thrown away but is also fast.

default: ``/var/cache/cobbler/buildiso``

cache_enabled
=============

If ``cache_enabled`` is ``True``, a cache will keep converted records in memory to make checking them faster. This helps
with use cases like writing out large numbers of records. There is a known issue with cache and remote XML-RPC API
calls. If you will use Cobbler with config management or infrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform, it is
recommended to disable by setting to ``False``.

default: ``True``

cheetah_import_whitelist
========================

Cheetah-language autoinstall templates can import Python modules. while this is a useful feature, it is not safe to
allow them to import anything they want. This whitelists which modules can be imported through Cheetah. Users can expand
this as needed but should never allow modules such as subprocess or those that allow access to the filesystem as Cheetah
templates are evaluated by ``cobblerd`` as code.

default:
 - ``random``
 - ``re``
 - ``time``
 - ``netaddr``

client_use_https
================

If set to ``True``, all commands to the API (not directly to the XML-RPC server) will go over HTTPS instead of plain
text. Be sure to change the ``http_port`` setting to the correct value for the web server.

default: ``False``

client_use_localhost
====================

If set to ``True``, all commands will be forced to use the localhost address instead of using the above value which can
force commands like ``cobbler sync`` to open a connection to a remote address if one is in the configuration and would
traceback.

default: ``False``

cobbler_master
==============

Used for replicating the Cobbler instance.

default: ``""``

convert_server_to_ip
====================

Convert hostnames to IP addresses (where possible) so DNS isn't a requirement for various tasks to work correctly.

default: ``False``

createrepo_flags
================

Default ``createrepo_flags`` to use for new repositories.

default: ``"-c cache -s sha"``

default_autoinstall
===================

If no autoinstall template is specified to profile add, use this template.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/templates/default.ks``

default_name_*
==============

Configure all installed systems to use these name servers by default unless defined differently in the profile. For DHCP
configurations you probably do **not** want to supply this.

defaults:

.. code:: YAML

    default_name_servers: []
    default_name_servers_search: []

default_ownership
=================

if using the ``authz_ownership`` module, objects created without specifying an owner are assigned to this owner and/or
group.

default:
 - ``admin``

default_password_crypted
========================

Cobbler has various sample automatic installation templates stored in ``/var/lib/cobbler/templates/``. This
controls what install (root) password is set up for those systems that reference this variable. The factory default is
"cobbler" and Cobbler check will warn if this is not changed. The simplest way to change the password is to run
``openssl passwd -1`` and put the output between the ``""``.

default: ``"$1$mF86/UHC$WvcIcX2t6crBz2onWxyac."``

default_template_type
=====================

The default template type to use in the absence of any other detected template. If you do not specify the template
with ``#template=<template_type>`` on the first line of your templates/snippets, Cobbler will assume try to use the
following template engine to parse the templates.

.. note:: Over time we will try to deprecate and remove Cheetah3 as a template engine. It is hard to package and there
          are fewer guides then with Jinja2. Making the templating independent of the engine is a task which complicates
          the code. Thus, please try to use Jinja2. We will try to support a seamless transition on a best-effort basis.

Current valid values are: ``cheetah``, ``jinja2``

default: ``"cheetah"``

default_virt_bridge
===================

For libvirt based installs in Koan, if no virt-bridge is specified, which bridge do we try? For EL 4/5 hosts this should
be ``xenbr0``, for all versions of Fedora, try ``virbr0``. This can be overridden on a per-profile basis or at the Koan
command line though this saves typing to just set it here to the most common option.

default: ``xenbr0``

default_virt_disk_driver
========================

The on-disk format for the virtualization disk.

default: ``raw``

default_virt_file_size
======================

Use this as the default disk size for virt guests (GB).

default: ``5``

default_virt_ram
================

Use this as the default memory size for virt guests (MB).

default: ``512``

default_virt_type
=================

If Koan is invoked without ``--virt-type`` and no virt-type is set on the profile/system, what virtualization type
should be assumed?

Current valid values are:

- ``xenpv``
- ``xenfv``
- ``qemu``
- ``vmware``

**NOTE**: this does not change what ``virt_type`` is chosen by import.

default: ``xenpv``

enable_gpxe
===========

Enable gPXE booting? Enabling this option will cause Cobbler to copy the ``undionly.kpxe`` file to the TFTP root
directory, and if a profile/system is configured to boot via gPXE it will chain load off ``pxelinux.0``.

.. note:: We now gPXE is not active anymore and try to transition the code, settings and guide we have to iPXE.

default: ``False``

enable_menu
===========

Controls whether Cobbler will add each new profile entry to the default PXE boot menu. This can be over-ridden on a
per-profile basis when adding/editing profiles with ``--enable-menu=False/True``. Users should ordinarily leave this
setting enabled unless they are concerned with accidental reinstall from users who select an entry at the PXE boot
menu. Adding a password to the boot menus templates may also be a good solution to prevent unwanted reinstallations.

default: ``True``

http_port
=========

Change this port if Apache is not running plain text on port 80. Most people can leave this alone.

default: ``80``

include
=======

Include other configuration snippets with this regular expression. This is a list of folders.

default: ``[ "/etc/cobbler/settings.d/*.settings" ]``

iso_template_dir
================

Folder to search for the ISO templates. These will build the boot-menu of the built ISO.

default: ``/etc/cobbler/iso``

jinja2_includedir
=================

This is a directory of files that Cobbler uses to include files into Jinja2 templates. Per default this settings is
commented out.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/jinja2``

kernel_options
==============

Kernel options that should be present in every Cobbler installation. Kernel options can also be applied at the
distro/profile/system level.

default: ``{}``

ldap_*
======
Configuration options if using the authn_ldap module. See the Wiki for details. This can be ignored if you are not
using LDAP for WebUI/XML-RPC authentication.

defaults:

.. code::

    ldap_server: "ldap.example.com"
    ldap_base_dn: "DC=example,DC=com"
    ldap_port: 389
    ldap_tls: true
    ldap_anonymous_bind: true
    ldap_search_bind_dn: ''
    ldap_search_passwd: ''
    ldap_search_prefix: 'uid='
    ldap_tls_cacertfile: ''
    ldap_tls_keyfile: ''
    ldap_tls_certfile: ''

bind_manage_ipmi
================

When using the Bind9 DNS server, you can enable or disable if the BMCs should receive own DNS entries.

default: ``False``

manage_dhcp
===========

Set to ``True`` to enable Cobbler's DHCP management features. The choice of DHCP management engine is in
``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf``.

default: ``True``

manage_dns
==========

Set to ``True`` to enable Cobbler's DNS management features. The choice of DNS management engine is in
``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf``.

default: ``False``

manage_*_zones
==============

If using BIND (named) for DNS management in ``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf`` and ``manage_dns`` is enabled (above), this
lists which zones are managed. See :ref:`dns-management` for more information.

defaults:

.. code::

    manage_forward_zones: []
    manage_reverse_zones: []

manage_genders
==============

Whether or not to manage the genders file. For more information on that visit:
`github.com/chaos/genders <https://github.com/chaos/genders>`_

default: ``False``

manage_rsync
============

Set to ``True`` to enable Cobbler's RSYNC management features.

default: ``False``

manage_tftpd
==============

Set to ``True`` to enable Cobbler's TFTP management features. The choice of TFTP management engine is in
``/etc/cobbler/modules.conf``.

default: ``True``

mgmt_*
======

Cobbler has a feature that allows for integration with config management systems such as Puppet. The following
parameters work in conjunction with ``--mgmt-classes`` and are described in further detail at
:ref:`configuration-management`.

.. code-block:: YAML

    mgmt_classes: []
    mgmt_parameters:
        from_cobbler: true

next_server
===========

If using Cobbler with ``manage_dhcp``, put the IP address of the Cobbler server here so that PXE booting guests can find
it. If you do not set this correctly, this will be manifested in TFTP open timeouts.

default: ``127.0.0.1``

nsupdate_enabled
================

This enables or disables the replacement (or removal) of records in the DNS zone for systems created (or removed) by
Cobbler.

.. note:: There are additional settings needed when enabling this. Due to the limited number of resources, this won't
          be done until 3.3.0. Thus please expect to run into troubles when enabling this setting.

default: ``False``

nsupdate_log
============

The logfile to document what records are added or removed in the DNS zone for systems.

.. note:: The functionality this settings is related to is currently not tested due to tech-debt. Please use it with
          caution. This note will be removed once we were able to look deeper into this functionality of Cobbler.

- Required: No
- Default: ``/var/log/cobbler/nsupdate.log``

nsupdate_tsig_algorithm
=======================

.. note:: The functionality this settings is related to is currently not tested due to tech-debt. Please use it with
          caution. This note will be removed once we were able to look deeper into this functionality of Cobbler.

- Required: No
- Default: ``hmac-sha512``

nsupdate_tsig_key
=================

.. note:: The functionality this settings is related to is currently not tested due to tech-debt. Please use it with
          caution. This note will be removed once we were able to look deeper into this functionality of Cobbler.

- Required: No
- Default: ``[]``

power_management_default_type
=============================

Settings for power management features. These settings are optional. See :ref:`power-management` to learn more.

Choices (refer to the `fence-agents project <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/fence-agents>`_ for a complete list):

- apc_snmp
- bladecenter
- bullpap
- drac
- ether_wake
- ilo
- integrity
- ipmilan
- ipmilanplus
- lpar
- rsa
- virsh
- wti

default: ``ipmilanplus``

proxy_url_ext
=============

External proxy which is used by the following commands: ``reposync``, ``signature update``

defaults:

.. code::

  http: http://192.168.1.1:8080
  https: https://192.168.1.1:8443

proxy_url_int
=============

Internal proxy which is used by systems to reach Cobbler for kickstarts.

e.g.: ``proxy_url_int: http://10.0.0.1:8080``

default: ``""``

puppet_auto_setup
=================

If enabled, this setting ensures that puppet is installed during machine provision, a client certificate is generated
and a certificate signing request is made with the puppet master server.

default: ``False``

puppet_parameterized_classes
============================

Choose whether to enable puppet parameterized classes or not. Puppet versions prior to 2.6.5 do not support parameters.

default: ``True``

puppet_server
=============

Choose a ``--server`` argument when running puppetd/puppet agent during autoinstall.

default: ``'puppet'``

puppet_version
==============

Let Cobbler know that you're using a newer version of puppet. Choose version 3 to use: 'puppet agent'; version 2 uses
status quo: 'puppetd'.

default: ``2``

puppetca_path
=============

Location of the puppet executable, used for revoking certificates.

default: ``"/usr/bin/puppet"``

pxe_just_once
=============

If this setting is set to ``True``, Cobbler systems that pxe boot will request at the end of their installation to
toggle the ``--netboot-enabled`` record in the Cobbler system record. This eliminates the potential for a PXE boot loop
if the system is set to PXE first in it's BIOS order. Enable this if PXE is first in your BIOS boot order, otherwise
leave this disabled. See the manpage for ``--netboot-enabled``.

default: ``True``

nopxe_with_triggers
===================

If this setting is set to ``True``, triggers will be executed when systems will request to toggle the
``--netboot-enabled`` record at the end of their installation.

default: ``True``

redhat_management_permissive
============================

If using ``authn_spacewalk`` in ``modules.conf`` to let Cobbler authenticate against Satellite/Spacewalk's auth system,
by default it will not allow per user access into Cobbler Web and Cobbler XML-RPC. In order to permit this, the following
setting must be enabled HOWEVER doing so will permit all Spacewalk/Satellite users of certain types to edit all of
Cobbler's configuration. these roles are: ``config_admin`` and ``org_admin``. Users should turn this on only if they
want this behavior and do not have a cross-multi-org separation concern. If you have a single org in your satellite,
it's probably safe to turn this on and then you can use CobblerWeb alongside a Satellite install.

default: ``False``

redhat_management_server
========================

This setting is only used by the code that supports using Uyuni/SUSE Manager/Spacewalk/Satellite authentication within Cobbler Web and
Cobbler XML-RPC.

default: ``"xmlrpc.rhn.redhat.com"``

redhat_management_key
=====================

Specify the default Red Hat authorization key to use to register system. If left blank, no registration will be
attempted. Similarly you can set the ``--redhat-management-key`` to blank on any system to keep it from trying to
register.

default: ``""``

edhat_management_org
#####################

Specify the default Red Hat organization ID to use to register system.  Used in combination with
redhat_management_key above.

default: ``""``

redhat_management_user
######################

Specify the default Red Hat user to use to register system. If left blank, no registration will be
attempted. Similarly you can set the ``--redhat-management-user`` to blank on any system to keep it from trying to
register.

default: ``""``

redhat_management_password
##########################

Specify the default Red Hat password to use to register system.  Used in combination with
redhat_management_user above.

default: ``""``

register_new_installs
=====================

If set to ``True``, allows ``/usr/bin/cobbler-register`` (part of the Koan package) to be used to remotely add new
Cobbler system records to Cobbler. This effectively allows for registration of new hardware from system records.

default: ``False``

remove_old_puppet_certs_automatically
=====================================

When a puppet managed machine is reinstalled it is necessary to remove the puppet certificate from the puppet master
server before a new certificate is signed (see above). Enabling the following feature will ensure that the certificate
for the machine to be installed is removed from the puppet master server if the puppet master server is running on the
same machine as Cobbler. This requires ``puppet_auto_setup`` above to be enabled

default: ``False``

replicate_repo_rsync_options
============================

Replication rsync options for repos set to override default value of ``-avzH``.

default: ``"-avzH"``

replicate_rsync_options
=======================

replication rsync options for distros, autoinstalls, snippets set to override default value of ``-avzH``.

default: ``"-avzH"``

reposync_flags
==============

Flags to use for yum's reposync. If your version of yum reposync does not support ``-l``, you may need to remove that
option.

default: ``"-l -n -d"``

reposync_rsync_flags
====================
Flags to use for rysync's reposync. If archive mode (-a,--archive) is used then createrepo is not ran after the rsync as
it pulls down the repodata as well. This allows older OS's to mirror modular repos using rsync.

default: ``"-rltDv --copy-unsafe-links"``

restart_*
=========

When DHCP and DNS management are enabled, ``cobbler sync`` can automatically restart those services to apply changes.
The exception for this is if using ISC for DHCP, then OMAPI eliminates the need for a restart. ``omapi``, however, is
experimental and not recommended for most configurations. If DHCP and DNS are going to be managed, but hosted on a box
that is not on this server, disable restarts here and write some other script to ensure that the config files get
copied/rsynced to the destination box. This can be done by modifying the restart services trigger. Note that if
``manage_dhcp`` and ``manage_dns`` are disabled, the respective parameter will have no effect. Most users should not
need to change this.

defaults:

.. code:: YAML

    restart_dns: true
    restart_dhcp: true

run_install_triggers
====================

Install triggers are scripts in ``/var/lib/cobbler/triggers/install`` that are triggered in autoinstall pre and post
sections. Any executable script in those directories is run. They can be used to send email or perform other actions.
They are currently run as root so if you do not need this functionality you can disable it, though this will also
disable ``cobbler status`` which uses a logging trigger to audit install progress.

default: ``true``

scm_track_*
===========

enables a trigger which version controls all changes to ``/var/lib/cobbler`` when add, edit, or sync events are
performed. This can be used to revert to previous database versions, generate RSS feeds, or for other auditing or backup
purposes. Git and Mercurial are currently supported, but Git is the recommend SCM for use with this feature.

default:

.. code:: YAML

    scm_track_enabled: false
    scm_track_mode: "git"
    scm_track_author: "cobbler <cobbler@localhost>"
    scm_push_script: "/bin/true"

serializer_pretty_json
======================

Sort and indent JSON output to make it more human-readable.

default: ``False``

server
======

This is the address of the Cobbler server -- as it is used by systems during the install process, it must be the address
or hostname of the system as those systems can see the server. if you have a server that appears differently to
different subnets (dual homed, etc), you need to read the ``--server-override`` section of the manpage for how that
works.

default: ``127.0.0.1``

sign_puppet_certs_automatically
===============================

When puppet starts on a system after installation it needs to have its certificate signed by the puppet master server.
Enabling the following feature will ensure that the puppet server signs the certificate after installation if the puppet
master server is running on the same machine as Cobbler. This requires ``puppet_auto_setup`` above to be enabled.

default: ``false``

signature_path
==============

The ``cobbler import`` workflow is powered by this file. Its location can be set with this config option.

default: ``/var/lib/cobbler/distro_signatures.json``

signature_url
=============

Updates to the signatures may happen more often then we have releases. To enable you to import new version we provide
the most up to date signatures we offer on this like. You may host this file for yourself and adjust it for your needs.

default: ``https://cobbler.github.io/signatures/3.0.x/latest.json``

tftpboot_location
=================

This variable contains the location of the tftpboot directory. If this directory is not present Cobbler does not start.

Default: ``/srv/tftpboot``

virt_auto_boot
==============

Should new profiles for virtual machines default to auto booting with the physical host when the physical host reboots?
This can be overridden on each profile or system object.

default: ``true``

webdir
======

Cobbler's web directory.  Don't change this setting -- see the Wiki on "relocating your Cobbler install" if your /var partition
is not large enough.

default: ``@@webroot@@/cobbler``

webdir_whitelist
================

Directories that will not get wiped and recreated on a ``cobbler sync``.

default:

.. code::

    webdir_whitelist:
      - misc
      - web
      - webui
      - localmirror
      - repo_mirror
      - distro_mirror
      - images
      - links
      - pub
      - repo_profile
      - repo_system
      - svc
      - rendered
      - .link_cache

xmlrpc_port
===========

Cobbler's public XML-RPC listens on this port. Change this only if absolutely needed, as you'll have to start supplying
a new port option to Koan if it is not the default.

default: ``25151``

yum_distro_priority
===================

The default yum priority for all the distros. This is only used if yum-priorities plugin is used. 1 is the maximum
value. Tweak with caution.

default: ``true``

yum_post_install_mirror
=======================

``cobbler repo add`` commands set Cobbler up with repository information that can be used during autoinstall and is
automatically set up in the Cobbler autoinstall templates. By default, these are only available at install time. To
make these repositories usable on installed systems (since Cobbler makes a very convenient mirror) set this to ``True``.
Most users can safely set this to ``True``. Users who have a dual homed Cobbler server, or are installing laptops that
will not always have access to the Cobbler server may wish to leave this as ``False``. In that case, the Cobbler
mirrored yum repos are still accessible at ``http://cobbler.example.org/cblr/repo_mirror`` and YUM configuration can
still be done manually. This is just a shortcut.

default: ``True``

yumdownloader_flags
===================

Flags to use for yumdownloader. Not all versions may support ``--resolve``.

default: ``"--resolve"``

``modules.conf``
################

If you have own custom modules which are not shipped with Cobbler directly you may have additional sections here.

authentication
==============

What users can log into the WebUI and Read-Write XML-RPC?

Choices:

- authn_denyall    -- no one (default)
- authn_configfile -- use /etc/cobbler/users.digest (for basic setups)
- authn_passthru   -- ask Apache to handle it (used for kerberos)
- authn_ldap       -- authenticate against LDAP

authorization
=============

Once a user has been cleared by the WebUI/XML-RPC, what can they do?

Choices:

- authz_allowall   -- full access for all authenticated users (default)
- authz_ownership  -- use users.conf, but add object ownership semantics
- (user supplied)  -- you may write your own module

**WARNING**: this is a security setting, do not choose an option blindly.
If you want to further restrict Cobbler with ACLs for various groups,
pick authz_ownership.  authz_allowall does not support ACLs. Configuration
file does but does not support object ownership which is useful as an
additional layer of control.
