Power Management
***********************************

Cobbler allows for linking your power management systems with cobbler, making it very easy to make changes to your
systems when you want to reinstall them, or just use it to remember what the power management settings for all of your
systems are. For instance, you can just change what profile they should run and flip their power states to begin the
reinstall!

What's Supported
################

All of the following modes are supported. Most all of them use the fence scripts internally so you will want fence
installed. This is part of the 'cman' package for some distributions, though it's fence-agents in Fedora 11 and later
(which cobbler has as a dependency on that OS for newer versions).

* bullpap
* wti
* apc_snmp
* ether_wake
* ipmilan
* drac
* ipmitool
* ilo
* rsa
* lpar
* bladecenter
* and many more...

Example of Set Up
#################

You have a WTI powerbar. Define that system foo is a part of that powerbar on plug 7

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system edit --name foo --power-type=wti --power-address=foo-mgmt.example.org --power-user Administrator --power-pass PASSWORD --power-id 7

You have a DRAC based blade:

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system edit --name blade7 --power-type=drac --power-address=blade-mgmt.example.org --power-user Administrator --power-pass=PASSWORD --power-id blade7

You have an IPMI based system:

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system edit --name foo --power-type=ipmi --power-address=foo-mgmt.example.org --power-user Administrator --power-pass=PASSWORD

You have a IBM HMC managed system:

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system edit --name 9115-505 --power-type=lpar --power-address=ibm-hmc.example.org --power-user hscroot --power-pass=PASSWORD --power-id system:partition

.. note:: The *--power-id* option is used to indicate **both** the managed system name and a logical partition name.
          Since an IBM HMC is responsible for managing more than one system, you must supply the managed system name
          and logical partition name separated by a colon (':') in the --power-id command-line option.

You have an IBM Bladecenter:

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system edit --name blade-06 --power-type=bladecenter --power-address=blademm.example.org --power-user USERID --power-pass=PASSW0RD --power-id 6

.. note:: The ``*--power-id*`` option is used to specify what slot your blade is connected.

Data Entry
##########

Tip: to make life easier, you can use
cobbler find + xargs [CommandLineSearch](Command Line Search)
to batch populate the settings for lots of systems.

Defaults
########

If ``--power-user`` and ``--power-pass`` are left blank, the values of ``default_power_user`` and ``default_power_pass``
will be loaded from cobblerd's environment at the time of usage.

``--power-type`` also has a default value in our settings, initially set to "ipmilanplus".

Using the Power Management Features
###################################

Assigning A System To Be Installed To A New Profile

.. code-block:: shell

   obbler system edit --name=foo --netboot-enabled=1 --profile=install-this-profile-name-instead

Powering Off A System

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system poweroff --name=foo

Powering On A System

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system poweron --name=foo

Rebooting A System (if netboot-enabled is turned on, it will now
reinstall to the new profile -- assuming PXE is working)

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system reboot --name=foo

Since not all power management systems support reboot, this is a "power off, sleep for 1 second, and power on"
operation.

Important: Security Implications
################################

Storing the power control usernames and passwords in Cobbler means that information is essentially public (this data is
available via XMLRPC without access control), therefore you will want to control what machines have network access to
contact the power management devices if you use this feature (such as /only/ the cobbler machine, and then control who
has local access to the cobbler machine). Also do not reuse important passwords for your power management devices. If
this concerns you, you can still use this feature, just don't store the username/password in Cobbler for your
power management devices.

If you are not going to to store power control passwords in Cobbler, leave the username and password fields blank.

Cobbler will first try to source them from it's environment using the ``COBBLER_POWER_USER`` and ``COBBLER_POWER_PASS``
variables.

This may also be too insecure for some, so in this case, don't set these, and supply ``--power-user`` and
``--power-pass`` when running commands like ``cobbler system poweron`` and ``cobbler system poweroff``. The values used
on the command line are always used, regardless of the value stored in Cobbler or the environment, if so provided.

.. code-block:: shell

   cobbler system poweron --name=foo --power-user=X --power-pass=Y

Be advised of current limitations in storing passwords, make your choices accordingly and in relation to the
ease-of-use that you need, and secure your networks appropriately.
