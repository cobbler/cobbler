# choices:
#    authentication.denyall    -- no one (default)
#    authentication.configfile -- use /etc/cobbler/users.digest (for basic setups)
#    authentication.passthru   -- ask Apache to handle it (used for kerberos)
#    authentication.ldap       -- authenticate against LDAP
#    authentication.spacewalk  -- ask Spacewalk/Satellite (experimental)
#    authentication.pam        -- use PAM facilities

# authorization: 
# once a user has been cleared by the WebUI/XMLRPC, what can they do?
# choices:
#    authorization.allowall   -- full access for all authneticated users (default)
#    authorization.ownership  -- use users.conf, but add object ownership semantics
#    (user supplied)  -- you may write your own module
# WARNING: this is a security setting, do not choose an option blindly.
# If you want to further restrict cobbler with ACLs for various groups,
# pick authorization.ownership. authorization.ownership does not support ACLs.  configfile
# does but does not support object ownership which is useful as an additional
# layer of control.
