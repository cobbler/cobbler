# cobbler module configuration file
# =================================

# authentication: 
# Decides what users can log into the WebUI and call Read-Write XMLRPC methods.
# Choices:
#    authentication.denyall    -- No one (default)
#    authentication.configfile -- Use /etc/cobbler/users.digest (for basic setups)
#    authentication.passthru   -- Ask Apache to handle it (used for kerberos)
#    authentication.ldap       -- Authenticate against LDAP
#    authentication.spacewalk  -- Ask Spacewalk/Satellite (experimental)
#    authentication.pam        -- Use PAM facilities
#    authentication.testing    -- Username/password is always testing/testing (debug)
#    (user supplied)  -- You may write your own module
# WARNING: This is a security setting, do not choose an option blindly.

# hash_algorithm: This parameter has currently only a meaning when the option authentication.configfile is used.
#                 The parameter decides what hashfun algorithm is used for checking the passwords.
#                 Currently available are: sha3_384, sha3_512, blake2b, sha3_224, blake2s, shake_128, shake_256,
#                                          sha3_256

# authorization: 
# once a user has been cleared by the WebUI/XMLRPC, what can they do?
# choices:
#    authorization.allowall   -- full access for all authneticated users (default)
#    authorization.ownership  -- use users.conf, but add object ownership semantics
#    (user supplied)  -- you may write your own module
# WARNING: this is a security setting, do not choose an option blindly.
# If you want to further restrict cobbler with ACLs for various groups,
# pick authorization.ownership. authorization.ownership does not support ACLs.  configfile
# does but does not support object ownership which is useful as an additional
# layer of control.
