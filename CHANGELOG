- Unbundle Cheetah as it's available at http://www.python.org/pyvault/centos-4-i386/

* Mon Feb 19 2007 - 0.4.0
- Added feature to minimize the need to run "cobbler sync" for add commands
  Now only need to run sync when files change behind the scenes or when
  manually editing YAML
- Moving back to Cheetah for templating (old kickstarts should escape $ with \$)
- PXE menus for the default profile.  Type "menu" at the prompt to get a menu, or wait for local boot.
- Manpage cleanup and clarification
- Bugfix: cobbler will no longer create repo files on remotes when --local-filename is not used for "repo add"

* Mon Jan 28 2007 - 0.3.9
- Make init scripts correspond with FC-E guidelines

- Default/examples kickstarts are now fully automatic (added hd type/size detection).

- Added fc6 kickstart file that was left out of the RPM earlier

- bugfix: don't install mod_python watcher on older Apache installs (like RHEL4) as it
  somehow corrupts downloads on older copies.  kickstart tracking by syslog still works
  on those platforms.  (This only applies to the cobbler server, not clients).

- locking feature now enabled
- "enchant" now supports provisioning virtual images remotely when using --is-virt=yes

  are deleted.  This allows /tftpboot to be used for other
  purposes.

* Thr Oct 25 2006 - 0.3.2
- By default, boot and install in text mode

* Wed Oct 25 2006 - 0.3.1
- The app now refers to "virt" in many places instead of "xen".
  It's been coded such that files will migrate forward without
  any major issues, and the newer version of koan can still hit
  older releases (for now).  The CLI still takes the --xen options
  as well as the new --virt options, as they are aliased.  The API
  now exclusively just uses methods with "virt" in them, however.
