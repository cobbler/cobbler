- Added action class to the event log link to bring it inline with other table
  functions (gregswift@gmail.com)

- Fix for pxegen, where an image without a distro could cause a stack dump on
  cobbler sync (jimi@sngx.net)

  --available-as is specified. Also some cleanup to the debian/ubuntu import
  module for when --available-as is specified. (jimi@sngx.net)
- Modification to import processes so that rsync:// works as a path. These
  changes should also correct the incorrect linking issue where the link
  created in webdir/links/ pointed at a directory in ks_mirror without the arch
  specified, resulting in a broken link if --arch was specified on the command
  line Also removed the .old import modules for debian/ubuntu, which were
  replaced with the unified manage_import_debian_ubuntu.py (jimi@sngx.net)
- cleanup: use codes.VALID_OS_VERSIONS in the freebsd importer
  (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- cleanup: use codes.VALID_OS_VERSIONS in the debian/ubuntu importer

- Fix for koan, where vmwcreate.py was not updated to accept the network type,
  causing failures. (jimi@sngx.net)

  SECRET_KEY field in the Django settings.py with a random string

  this was missing was causing failures in the the pre/post puppet install
  modules. (jimi@sngx.net)
- set the auto-boot option for a virtual machine (ug@suse.de)
- Correction for koan using the incorrect default port for connecting to
  cobblerd (jimi@sngx.net)

- Add a proxy field to profile and system objects. This is useful for
  environments where systems are not allowed to make direct connections to the

- Tim Verhoeven <tim.verhoeven.be@gmail.com> (Tue. 08:35) (Cobbler attachment)
  Subject: [PATCH] Add support to koan to select type of network device to
  emulate To: cobbler development list <cobbler-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org>
  Date: Tue, 2 Aug 2011 14:35:21 +0200 (shenson@redhat.com)
- Hello, (shenson@redhat.com)
- scm_track: Add --all to git add options to handle deletions (tmz@pobox.com)
- Moved HEADER heredoc from action_buildiso.py to
  /etc/cobbler/iso/buildiso.header (gbailey@terremark.com)
- Enable replication for FreeBSD (jsabo@verisign.com)
- Merge branch 'master' into bridge-interface (jimi@sngx.net)
- Remove json settings from local_get_cobbler_xmlrpc_url() (jsabo@verisign.com)
- 1) Moving --subnet field to --netmask 2) Created DEPRECATED_FIELDS structure
  in field_info.py to deal with moves like this    * also applies to the
  bonding->interface_type move for bridged interface support (jimi@sngx.net)
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'jimi1283/bridge-interface' (shenson@redhat.com)
- Fixing up some serializer module stuff:  * detecting module load errors when
  trying to deserialize collections  * added a what() function to all the
  serializer modules for ID purposes  * error detection for mongo stuff,
  including pymongo import problems as well as connection issues
  (jimi@sngx.net)
- Cleanup of bonding stuff in all files, including webui and koan. Additional
  cleanup in the network config scripts, and re-added the modprobe.conf
  renaming code to the post install network config. (jimi@sngx.net)
- Initial rework to allow bridge/bridge slave interfaces Added static route
  configuration to pre_install_network_config Major cleanup/reworking of
  post_install_network_config script (jimi@sngx.net)
- Fix for bad commit of some json settings test (jimi@sngx.net)
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'jsabo/fbsdimport' (shenson@redhat.com)
- Adding initial support for FreeBSD media importing (jsabo@verisign.com)
- Setting TIME_ZONE to None in web/settings.py causes a 500 error on a RHEL5
  system with python 2.4 and django 1.1. Commenting out the config line has the
  same effect as setting it to None, and prevents the 500. (jimi@sngx.net)
- Fixes for importing RHEL6:  * path_tail() was previously moved to utils, a
  couple    places in the import modules still used self.path_tail    instead
  of utils.path_tail, causing a stack dump  * Fixed an issue in
  utils.path_tail(), which was using self.    still from when it was a member
  of the import class  * When mirror name was set on import and using
  --available-as,    it was appending a lot of junk instead of just using the
  specified    mirror name (jimi@sngx.net)
- Merge branch 'master' of git://git.fedorahosted.org/cobbler (jimi@sngx.net)
- Fix a quick error (shenson@redhat.com)
- Set the tftpboot dir for rhel6 hosts (jsabo@verisign.com)
- Fixed a typo (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Added an extra field in the system/interface item. The field is called
  "management" and should be used to identify the management interface, this
  could be useful information for multihomed systems. (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- In the event log view the data/time field got wrapped which is very annoying.
  Fast fix for now, i'm pretty sure there are better ways to do this.
  (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Event log soring on date reverted, let's sort on id instead. Reverse over
  events in the template. Convert gmtime in the template to localtime.
  (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Sort the event log by date/time (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Remove some unsupported OS versions from codes.py (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Some changes in the generate_netboot_iso function/code: - Users had to supply
  all system names on the commandline which they wanted to include in the ISO
  boot menu. This patch changes that behaviour; all systems are included by
  default now. You can still provide an override with the --systems parameter,
  thus making this feature more consistent with what one might expect from
  reading the help. - While at it I tried to make the code more readable and
  removed some unneeded iterations. - Prevent some unneeded kernel/initrd
  copies. - You can now override ip/netmask/gateway/dns parameters with
  corresponding kernel_options. - Fixed a bug for SuSE systems where ksdevice
  should be netdevice. - If no ksdevice/netdevice (or equivalent) has been
  supplied via kernel_options try to guess the proper interface to use, but
  don't just use one if we can't be sure about it (e.g. for multihomed
  systems). (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Add SLES 11 to codes.py (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Add support for Fedora15 to codes.py (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Django uses the timezone information from web/settings.py Changing the
  hardcoded value to None forces Django to use the systems timezone instead of
  this hardcoded value (jorgen.maas@gmail.com)
- Fix cobbler replication for non-RHEL hosts. The slicing used in the
  link_distro function didn't work for all distros. (jsabo@verisign.com)
- Fix vmware esx importing. It was setting the links dir to the dir the iso was
  mounted on import (jsabo@verisign.com)
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'jsabo/webuifun' (shenson@redhat.com)
- Fix bug with esxi replication. It wasn't rsyncing the distro over if the
  parentdir already existed. (jsabo@verisign.com)
- Merge branch 'master' of git://git.fedorahosted.org/cobbler (jimi@sngx.net)
- Initial commit for mongodb backend support and adding support for settings as
  json (jimi@sngx.net)
- Web UI patches from Greg Swift applied (jsabo@verisign.com)

  (shenson@redhat.com)
- missing manage_rsync option from config/settings (jsabo@criminal.org)
- Remove left-over debugging log message (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- SUSE requires the correct arch to find kernel+initrd on the inst-source
  (ug@suse.de)
- added autoyast=... parameter to the ISO building code when breed=suse
  (ug@suse.de)
- calculate meta data in the XML file without cheetah variables now
  (ug@suse.de)
- render the cheetah template before passing the XML to the python XML parser
  (ug@suse.de)
- made the pathes flexible to avoid problem on other distros than fedora/redhat
  (ug@suse.de)
- bugfix (ug@suse.de)
- Merge patch from stable (cristian.ciupitu@yahoo.com)
- utils: initialize main_logger only when needed (cristian.ciupitu@yahoo.com)
- During refactor, failed to move templater initialization into
  write_boot_files_distro. (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)

  tftpd.py, and fixed refences to api and os.path in manage_in_tftpd.py
  (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)

  (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- Merge conflict. (kilpatds@oppositelock.org)
- Add in a default for puppet_auto_setup, thanks to Camille Meulien
  <cmeulien@heliostech.fr> for finding it. (shenson@redhat.com)
- Add a directory remap feature to fetchable_files processing.    /foo/*=/bar/
  Client requests for "/foo/baz" will be turned into requests for /bar/baz.
  Target paths are evaluated against the root filesystem, not tftpboot.
  Template expansion is done on "bar/baz", so that would typically more
  usefully be something like         /boot/*=$distro_path/boot
  (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- Removed trailing whitespace causing git warnings (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- Fix a bug where tftpd.py would throw if a client requested '/'.
  (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- Allow slop in the config, not just the client.  modules: don't hardcode
  /tftpboot (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- Moved footer to actually float at the bottom of the page or visible section,
  whichever is further down. Unfortunately leaves a slightly larger margin pad
  on there.  Will have to see if it can be made cleaner (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed right padding on delete checkboxes (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Adjusted all the self closing tags to end eith a " />" instead of not having
  a space separating them (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added "add" button to the filter bit (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed "Enabled" label on checkboxes, this can be added via css as part of
  the theme if people want it using :after { content: " Enabled" } Padded the
  context-tip off the checkboxes so that it lines up with most of the other
  context tips instead of being burring in the middle of the form
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added bottom margin on text area so that it isn't as tight next to other form
  fields (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added id tags to the forms for ks templates and snippets Set some margins for
  those two forms, they were a bit scrunched because they didn't have a
  sectionbody fieldset and legend Removed inline formatting of input sizes on
  those two pages Set the textareas in those two pages via css
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Made the tooltips get hiddent except for on hover, with a small image
  displayed in their place (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added a top margin to the submit/reset buttons... looks cleaner having some
  space. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Changed generic edit form to the following: - Made blocks into fieldsets
  again, converting the h2 to a legend.  I didn't mean to change this the first
  time through. - Pulled up a level, removing the wrapping div, making each
  fieldset contain an order list, instead of each line being an ordered list,
  which was silly of me. - Since it went up a level, un-indented all of the
  internal html tags 2 spaces - changed the place holder for the network
  widgets to spans so that they displayed cleanly (Don't like the spans either,
  but its for the javascript) In the stylesheet just changed the
  div.sectionbody to ol.sectionbody (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed closing ul->div on multiselect section. Must have missed it a few
  commits ago. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- IE uses input styling such as borders even on checkboxes... was not intended,
  so has been cleared for checkboxes (gregswift@gmail.com)
- This is a change to the multiselect buttons view,  i didn't mean to commit
  the style sheet along with the spelling check fixes, but since I did might as
  well do the whole thing and then erevert it later if people dislike it
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed another postition mispelling (gregswift@gmail.com)
- fixed typo postition should be position (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Returned the multiselect section to being div's, since its actually not a set
  of list items, it is a single list item. Re-arranged the multiselect so that
  the buttons are centered between the two sections Removed all of the line
  breaks form that section Made the select box headings actually labels moved
  the order of multiselect after sectionbody definition due to inheritence
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Restored select boxes to "default" styling since they are not as cleanly css-
  able Made visibly selected action from Batch Actions bold, mainly so by
  default Batch Action is bold. Moved text-area and multi-select sizing into
  stylesheet. re-alphabetized some of the tag styles Made the default login's
  text inputs centered, since everything else on that page is
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added missing bracket from two commits ago in the stylesheet.
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Re-added the tool tips for when they exist in the edit forms and set a style
  on them. Removed an extraneous line break from textareas in edit form
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed javascript where I had used teh wrong quotes, thus breaking the network
  interface widgets (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added label and span to cleanup block (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added version across all of the template loads so that the footer is
  populated with it (gregswift@gmail.com)
- all css: - set overall default font size of 1em - added missing tags to the
  cleanup css block - fixed button layout -- list line buttons are smaller font
  to keep lines smaller -- set action input button's size - set indentation and
  bolding of items in batch action - redid the list formatting -- removed zebra
  stripes, they share the standard background now -- hover is now the
  background color of the old darker zebra stripe -- selected lines now
  background of the older light zebra stripe - added webkit border radius
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- generic_lists.tmpl - Removed force space on the checklists generic_lists.tmpl
  - Added javascript to allow for selected row highlighting
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed inline formatting from import.tmpl Made the context tips spans
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Made both filter-adder elements exist in the same li element
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added default formatting for ordered lists Added formatting for the new
  multiselect unordered list Changed old div definitions for the multiselect to
  li Added label formatting for inside sectionbody to line up all the forms.
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Adjusted multiselect section to be an unordered list instead of a div
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Moved the close list tag inside the for loop, otherwise we generate lots of
  nasty nested lists (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Changed edit templates to use ol instead of ul, because it apparently helps
  out those using screen readers, and we should be making things accessible,
  yes? (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Re-structured the edit templates to be unordered lists. Standardized the
  tooltip/contextual data as context-tip class Redid the delete setup so that
  its Delete->Really? Instead of Delete:Yes->Really?  Same number of check
  boxes. Setup the delete bit so that Delete and Really are labels for the
  checkboxes and there isn't extraneous html input tags (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added top margin on the filter adder (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Adjusted single action item buttons to be in the same list element, as it
  makes alignment cleaner, and more sense from a grouping standpoint Set
  submenubar default height to 26px Set submenubar's alignment to be as clean
  as I've been able to get so far. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Set background color back to original (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Adjusted all buttons to hover invert from blue to-blackish, the inverse of
  the normal links (which go blackish to blue) but left the text color the
  same.  i'm not sure its as pretty, but dfinately more readable.  Plus the
  color change scheme is more consistant. Also made table buttons smaller than
  other buttons (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed width on paginate select boxes to auto, instead of over 200px
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed margin around hr tag, waste of space, and looks closer to original
  now (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed extraneous body div by putting user div inside container.
  (gregswift@gmail.com)

  display on the screen.  less chance of horiz scroll (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fix to get login form a bit better placed without duplicate work
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- pan.action not needed... .action takes care of it (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed padding on login screen (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Redid action and button classes to make them look like buttons.. still needs
  work. Resized pointer classes to make things a bit more level on that row
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- New cleanup at the top negates the need for this table entry
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed the body height to 99%.  Was doing this for sticky footer, but
  current path says its not needed (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added some windows and mac default fonts Made the body relative, supposed to
  help with the layout Set text color to slightly off black.. was told there is
  some odd optical reasoning behind this (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Made class settings for the table rows a touch more specific in the css
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added "normalization" to clean up cross browser differences at top of
  style.css (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added button class to all buttons, submit, and resets (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed sectionheader to not be styled as actions... they are h2!
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed container reference from class to id (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added missing action class on the "Create new" links in generic_list.tmpl
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Revert part of 344969648c1ce1e753af because RHEL5's django doesn't support
  that (gregswift@gmail.com)
- removed underline on remaing links (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed the way the logo was placed on the page and removed the excess
  background setting. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Some cleanup to the style sheet along - removed fieldset since no more exist
  (not sure about this in long run.... we'll see) - cleaned up default style
  for ul cause it was causing override issues - got menubar and submenu bar
  mostly settled (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed submenu bar ul to be identified by id not class (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Rebuilt primary css stylesheet - not complete yet (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed logout from cobbler meft hand menu (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Next step in redoing layout: - added current logged in user and logout button
  to a div element at top of page - fixed content div from class to id - added
  footer (version entry doesn't work for some reason) - links to cobbler
  website (gregswift@gmail.com)
- in generic_list.tmpl - set the edit link to class 'action' - merged the
  creation of the edit action 'View kickstart' for system and profile
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Replaced tool tip as div+em with a span classed as tooltip. tooltip class
  just adds italic. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Fixed table header alignment to left (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Take the logo out of the html, making it a css element, but retain the
  location and basic feel of the placement. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Step one of redoing the action list, pagination and filters. - split
  pagination and filters to two tmpl files - pagination can be called on its
  own (so it can live in top and bottom theoretically) - filter will eventually
  include pagination so its on the bottom - new submenubar includes pagination
  - new submenubar does age specific actiosn as links instead of drop downs
  cause there is usually 1, rarely 2, never more. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed pagination from left hand column (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Removed an erroneous double quote from master.tmpl (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Went a bit overboard and re-adjusted whitespace in all the templates. Trying
  to do the code in deep blocks across templates can be a bit tedious and
  difficult to maintain. While the output is not perfect, at least the
  templates are more readable. (gregswift@gmail.com)

  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Added HTML5 autofocus attribute to login.tmpl.  Unsupported browsers just
  ignores this. (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Re-built login.tmpl: - logo isn't a link anymore back to the same page - logo
  is centered with the login form - fieldset has been removed - set a css class
  for the body of the login page, unused for now. And the css: - removed the
  black border from css - centered the login button as well
  (gregswift@gmail.com)
- Made the links and span.actions hover with the same color as used for the
  section headings (gregswift@gmail.com)

  issues with sync where dhcpd keeps the XMLRPC port open and prevents cobblerd
  from restarting (jimi@sngx.net)
- Cleanup of unneccsary widgets in distro/profile. These needed to be removed
  as part of the multiselect change. (jimi@sngx.net)

  side-by-side add/delete boxes, where values can be moved back and forth and
  only appear in one of the two boxes. (jimi@sngx.net)
- Fix for django traceback when logging into the web interface with a bad
  username and/or password (jimi@sngx.net)
- Fix for snippet/kickstart editing via the web interface, where a 'tainted

- added the single missed $idata.get() item (stuart@sjsears.com)
- updated post_install_network_config to use $idata.get(key, "") instead of
  $idata[key]. This stops rendering issues with the snippet when some keys are
  missing (for example after an upgrade from 2.0.X to 2.1.0, where a large
  number of new keys appear to have been added.) and prevents us from having to
  go through all system records and add default values for them.

  /var/cache/cobbler/buildiso by default. Added a /etc/cobbler/settings value
  of 'buildisodir' to make it setable by the end user. --tempdir will still
  overwrite either setting on the command line. (andrew@eiknet.com)
- Add img_path to the metadata[] so that it's rendered out in the esxi pxe
  templates. Add os_version checks for esxi in kickstart_done so that it uses
  wget or curl depending on what's known to be available.

  distros, profiles, repos and images to be synced without specifying each.

- Merge remote branch 'jsabo/kickstart_done' (shenson@redhat.com)
- Move kickstart_done and kickstart_start out of kickgen.py and into their own
  snippets. This also adds support for VMware ESX triggers and magic urls by
  checking for the "vmware" breed and then using curl when that's all thats
  available vs wget.  VMware's installer makes wget available during the %pre
  section but only curl is around following install at %post time.  Yay!  I've
  also updated the sample kickstarts to use $SNIPPET('kickstart_done') and
  $SNIPPET('kickstart_start') (jonathan.sabo@gmail.com)

- fast sync.  A new way of copying files around using a link cache.  It creates
  a link cache per device and uses it as an intermediary so that files that are
  the same are not copied multiple times.  Should greatly speed up sync times.

- A few small fixes and a new feature for the Python tftp server * Support
  environments where the MAC address is know, but the IP address   is not
  (private networks).  I do this by waiting for pxelinux.0 to   request a file
  with the mac address added to the filename, and then   look up the host by
  MAC. * Fix my MAC lookup logic.  I didn't know to look for the ARP type (01-,
  at least for ethernet) added by pxelinux.0 * Fix up some log lines to make
  more sense * Fix a bug where I didn't get handle an empty fetchable_files
  properly, and didn't fall back to checking for profile matches.
  (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- Two fixed to bad changes in my prior patch set.  Sorry about that. * Bad path
  in cobbler/action_sync.py.  No "templates" * Bad generation of the default
  boot menu.  The first initrd from a profile   was getting into the metadata
  cache and hanging around, thus becoming the   initrd for all labels.
  (dkilpatrick@verisign.com)
- A smart tftp server, and a module to manage it
  (dkilpatr@dkilpatr.verisign.com)
- Export the generated pxelinux.cfg file via the materialized system
  information RPC method.  This enables the python tftpd server below to serve
  that file up without any sync being required.
  (dkilpatr@dkilpatr.verisign.com)
- Move management of /tftpboot into modules.  This is a setup step for a later
  python tftpd server that will eliminate the need for much of this work.
  (dkilpatr@dkilpatr.verisign.com)
- Fetchable Files attribute:   Provides a new attribute similar in spirit to
  mgmt_files, but   with somewhat reversed meaning.
  (dkilpatr@dkilpatr.verisign.com)
- fix log rotation to actually work (bpeck@redhat.com)
- find_kernel and find_initrd already do the right checks for file_is_remote
  and return None if things are wrong. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- Trac #588 Add mercurial support for scm tracking (kelsey.hightower@gmail.com)
- Add a breed for scientific linux (shenson@redhat.com)
- "mgmt_parameters" for item_profile has the wrong default setting when
  creating a sub_profile. I'm assuming that <<inherit>> would be correct for a
  sub_profile as well. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- The new setup.py placed webui_content in the wrong spot...
  (akesling@redhat.com)
- Merge commit 'a81ca9a4c18f17f5f8d645abf03c0e525cd234e1' (jeckersb@redhat.com)

  (shenson@redhat.com)
- rhel5 doesn't build egg-info by default. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- Some systems don't reboot properly at the end of install. s390 being one of
  them. This post module will call power reboot if postreboot is in ks_meta for
  that system. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- Changes to allow s390 to work. s390 has a hard limit on the number of chars
  it can recieve. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- show netboot status via koan. This is really handy if you have a system which
  fails to pxe boot you can create a service in rc.local which checks the
  status of netboot and calls --replace-self for example. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- When adding in distros/profiles from disk don't bomb out if missing kernel or
  ramdisk. just don't add it. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- add X log to anamon tracking as well. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- Added new remote method clear_logs. Clearing console and anamon logs in %pre
  is too late if the install never happens. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- fixes /var/www/cobbler/svc/services.py to canonicalize the uri before parsing
  it. This fixes a regression with mod_wsgi enabled and trying to provision a
  rhel3 machine. (bpeck@redhat.com)
- anaconda umounts /proc on us while were still running. Deal with it.
  (bpeck@redhat.com)

  right places.  The paths are configurable like they were in the previous
  setup.py, but everything is much cleaner. (akesling@redhat.com)
- Removed unnecessary templating functionality from configuration generation
  (and setup.py) (akesling@redhat.com)
- Added more useful files to setup.py and MANIFEST.in as well as extra
  functionality which setup.py should contain. (akesling@redhat.com)
- Massive overhaul of setup.py .  Moved things around a little to clean up
  building/packaging/distributing.  The new setup.py is still incomplete.
  (akesling@redhat.com)
- RPM specific changes to setup.cfg. (akesling@redhat.com)
- Currently working through making setup.py functional for generating rpms
  dynamically.  setup.py is just cobbler-web at the moment... and it appears to
  work.  The next things to do are test the current RPM and add in
  functionality for reducing repetitive setup.py configuration lines.
  (akesling@redhat.com)
- Changed list-view edit link from a javascript onclick event to an actual
  link... so that you can now just open it in a new tab. (akesling@redhat.com)
- Added tip for random MAC Address functionality to System MAC Address field.
  (akesling@redhat.com)
- Added "Puppet Parameters" attribute to Profile and System items. The new
  input field is a textarea which takes proper a YAML formatted dictionary.

  services.py). (akesling@croissant.usersys.redhat.com)
- Resume apitesting assuming against local Cobbler server. (dgoodwin@rm-rf.ca)

  are deleted.  This allows /tftpboot to be used for other
  purposes.

* Wed Oct 25 2006 - 0.3.1
- The app now refers to "virt" in many places instead of "xen".
  It's been coded such that files will migrate forward without
  any major issues, and the newer version of koan can still hit
  older releases (for now).  The CLI still takes the --xen options
  as well as the new --virt options, as they are aliased.  The API
  now exclusively just uses methods with "virt" in them, however.
