# the fields has controls what data elements are part of each object.  To add a new field, just add a new
# entry to the list following some conventions to be described later.  You must also add a method called
# set_$fieldname.  Do not write a method called get_$fieldname, that will not be called.
#
# name | default | subobject default | display name | editable? | tooltip | values ? | type
#
# name -- what the filed should be called.   For the command line, underscores will be replaced with
#         a hyphen programatically, so use underscores to seperate things that are seperate words
#
# default value -- when a new object is created, what is the default value for this field?
#
# subobject default -- this applies ONLY to subprofiles, and is most always set to <<inherit>>.  If this
#                      is not item_profile.py it does not matter.  
#
# display name -- how the field shows up in the web application and the "cobbler report" command
#
# editable -- should the field be editable in the CLI and web app?  Almost always yes unless
#                it is an internalism.  Fields that are not editable are "hidden"
#
# tooltip -- the caption to be shown in the web app or in "commandname --help" in the CLI
#
# values -- for fields that have a limited set of valid options and those options are always fixed
#           (such as architecture type), the list of valid options goes in this field.  This should
#           almost always be a constant from codes.py
#
# type -- the type of the field.  Used to determine which HTML form widget is used in the web interface
#
# you will also notice some names start with "*" ... this denotes that the fields belong to
# interfaces, and only item_system.py should have these.   Each system may have multiple interfaces.
#
# the order in which the fields are listed (for all non-hidden fields) are the order they will
# appear in the web application (top to bottom).   The command line sorts fields alphabetically.
#
# field_info.py also contains a set of "Groups" that describe what other fields are associated with 
# what other fields.  This affects color coding and other display hints.  If you add a field
# please edit field_info.py carefully to match.
#
# additional:  see field_info.py for some display hints.  By default in the web app all fields
# are text fields unless field_info.py lists the field in one of those hashes.
#
# hidden fields should not be added without just cause, explanations about these are:
#
#   ctime, mtime -- times the object was modified, used internally by cobbler for API purposes
#   uid -- also used for some external API purposes
#   source_repos -- an artifiact of import, this is too complicated to explain on IRC so we just hide it 
#                   for RHEL split repos, this is a list of each of them in the install tree, used to generate
#                   repo lines in the kickstart to allow installation of x>=RHEL5.  Otherwise unimportant.
#   depth -- used for "cobbler list" to print the tree, makes it easier to load objects from disk also
#   tree_build_time -- loaded from import, this is not useful to many folks so we just hide it.  Avail over API.
#
# so to add new fields
#   (A) understand the above
#   (B) add a field below
#   (C) add a set_fieldname method
#   (D) you do not need to modify the CLI or webapp
#
# in general the set_field_name method should raise exceptions on invalid fields, always.   There are adtl
# validation fields in is_valid to check to see that two seperate fields do not conflict, but in general
# design issues that require this should be avoided forever more, and there are few exceptions.  Cobbler
# must operate as normal with the default value for all fields and not choke on the default values.
