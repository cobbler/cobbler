# Cobbler WebUI / Web Services authorization config file
#
# NOTICE:
# this file is only used when /etc/cobbler/modules.conf
# specifies an authorization mode of either:
#
#   (A) authz_configfile
#   (B) authz_ownership
#
# For (A), any user in this file, in any group, are allowed
# full access to any object in cobbler configuration.
#
# For (B), users in the "admins" group are allowed full access
# to any object, otherwise users can only edit an object if
# their username/group is listed as an owner of that object. If a
# user is not listed in this file they will have no access.
#
#     cobbler command line example:
#
#     cobbler system edit --name=server1 --owner=dbas,mac,pete,jack
#
# NOTE:  yes, you do need the equal sign after the names.
# don't remove that part.  It's reserved for future use.
